## Overview

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). It aims to create a visually appealing and visually as close as possible to the original NFT preview card.

### The challenge

The challenge in this project was to create an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) preview card component. The goal was to build a visually appealing and interactive card that showcases an NFT artwork along with relevant information. The specific tasks included:

- Displaying the main image of the NFT artwork along with a hover effect that reveals an eye icon.
- Implementing a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Styling the text elements, such as the NFT title and description, with appropriate fonts, colors, and sizes.
- Incorporating icons for Ethereum, price, and time remaining, along with their corresponding information.
- Creating a visually pleasing design with appropriate spacing, alignment, and borders.
- Enhancing user experience through interactive elements, such as hover effects and clickable elements.

## My process

### Built with

The NFT preview card component was built using the following technologies and tools:

- HTML5: The project utilized HTML5 to structure the content and elements of the card component, including the main div, headings, paragraphs, and images.

- CSS3: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) was used extensively to style and enhance the visual presentation of the card component. This included custom styles for backgrounds, borders, colors, fonts, and spacing. Flexbox was utilized for layout and alignment of elements.

- Google Fonts: The project integrated the "Outfit" font from Google Fonts to achieve a visually appealing typography style. This font was applied to headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the card.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills. Here are some key things I learned:

- Utilizing flexbox: I deepened my understanding of flexbox and its powerful capabilities for creating responsive layouts. I applied flexbox to achieve proper alignment and spacing of elements within the card component.

- Managing div relationships: I learned how to structure and organize div elements to establish the desired relationships between different sections of the card component. This allowed me to create a logical hierarchy and improve the overall structure of the HTML code.

- Implementing hover effects: I explored the use of CSS hover effects to enhance interactivity and user experience. By utilizing the :hover selector, I successfully implemented the eye icon reveal and background opacity change on hover.

- Working with background and position properties: I gained hands-on experience in utilizing CSS background properties and position values. This allowed me to create visually appealing backgrounds and properly position elements, such as the eye icon and background overlay, to achieve the desired effects.

### Continued development

I aspire to dive deeper into CSS and explore more advanced techniques and concepts. This includes mastering CSS Grid, learning CSS animations and transitions, and exploring responsive design patterns to create truly dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With the increasing use of mobile devices, it's crucial to create websites that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. I want to focus on mastering responsive design principles and adopting a mobile-first approach, ensuring that my projects are accessible and provide a great user experience across all devices.
